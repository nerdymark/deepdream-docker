      "\n",
      "\"From a national level, we've seen more and more evidence to support the belief that men are underrepresented in the leadership of women's organizations,\" said University of Michigan professor, Jessica Rinaldi, who is studying inequality in the STEM fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These results demonstrate that men are being held back because of their race, ethnic or sexual/gender identities, and we're not alone,\" she said. \"We have a lot to be doing to make sure that the gender gap in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) is much smaller.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The study, \"A Gender Gap in STEM Leadership: How Do Men and Women Compare?\" was led by Dr. Rinaldi, also a faculty member with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study was published in the journal Social Psychology & Theology for the journal Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, with research also commissioned by the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers looked at a number of data on various levels, including data on how organizations are run by the executive vice presidents of each university, senior leadership in the American Society of Collegiate Registrars, and female STEM-related leaders at universities in the U.S. and abroad. The research team also sought to determine the level of gender diversity amongst these groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the study, women hold less than 5 percent of the executive vice presidents of the American Association of Public Administration, and of the 742 leaders of the American Society of Collegiate Registrars, only 3.4 percent are women, while more than 85 percent of women on the board of directors or at the National Association of Manufacturers are on female boards. And only 5 percent of the executives in companies such as Walmart are women, the same as men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of a typical office holder, just under half – 49 percent – are male; men hold approximately one-fourth of the top offices. Men earn about $90,000 on average annually in the private sector, but women earn a total of $67,600 annually. There is no gender gap in the earnings of corporate America.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Rinaldi believes this is because, unlike most other careers, the corporate career field is based primarily on leadership, not salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Women hold less than 5 percent of the executive vice presidents of the American Association of Public Administration, and of the 742 leaders of the American Society of Collegiate Registrars, only 3.4 percent are women, while more than 85 percent of women on the board of directors or at the National Association of Manufacturers are on female boards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Women may be overrepresented in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) fields, and are underrepresented in some male-dominated occupations that often are male-dominated, though these disparities have come to be seen as a small disadvantage, the study states.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers are also studying how the diversity of people in society differs within each gender. \"One of the main results is an apparent gender difference in the diversity of people for whom these variables and others were significantly (P<.08,\" they say). For example, of the 1829 faculty of Stanford University (women make up less than 19 percent of the faculty; women earn about 60 percent of the median salary of $100,000), only about 2.5 percent were women and only about 5 percent were men: this is a significant and possibly significant gap in both gender ratios.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, this study confirms what we already know: Women are underrepresented in STEM and in some occupations. How? In the form of discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea that women were discriminated against for participating in the 'Women Power' coalition is a common one and may be an exaggeration, but this does illustrate a problem which is real and that needs to be corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has got to stop with the current political rhetoric. It's time the American women took political responsibility back. Let's not make people believe that the system is rigged.\n",
